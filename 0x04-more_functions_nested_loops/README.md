# C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

Welcome to my C project directory for more functions and nested loops tasks. This project directory contains a series of tasks that are designed to cover more implementations of the afore-mentioned concepts in C. I am doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).

## Tasks

- 0. isupper
- 1. isdigit
- 2. Collaboration is multiplication
- 3. The numbers speak for themselves
- 4. I believe in numbers and signs
- 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
- 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
- 7.
