# C - Dynamic Libraries

Welcome to my C project directory on dynamic libraries. This project directory has tasks on dynamic libraries in C. I am doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).

## Tasks

- 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
- 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
