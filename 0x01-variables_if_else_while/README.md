# C - Variables, if, else, while

Welcome to my first C project directory for variables, if, else, and while concepts. This project directory contains a series of tasks that are designed to cover fundamentals of the afore-mentioned concepts in C. I am doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).

## Tasks

- 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- 1. The last digit
- 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- 3. alphABET
- 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- 5. Numbers
- 6. Numberz
- 7.
