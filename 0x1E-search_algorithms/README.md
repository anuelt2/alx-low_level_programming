# C - Search Algorithms

Welcome to my C project directory on Search Algorithms. This project focuses on the implemetation of search algorithms in C, including time and space complexities of different search algorithms, and given different parameters. Doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).

## Tasks

0. Linear search
1. Binary search
2. Big O #0
3. Big O #1
4. Big O #2
5. Big O #3
6. Big O #4
7.
