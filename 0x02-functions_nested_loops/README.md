# C - Functions, Nested Loops

Welcome to my first C project directory for functions and nested loops concepts. This project directory contains a series of tasks that are designed to cover fundamentals of the afore-mentioned concepts in C. I am doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).

## Tasks

- 0. \_putchar
- 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- 2. 10 x alphabet
- 3. islower
- 4. isalpha
- 5. Sign
- 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
- 7.
