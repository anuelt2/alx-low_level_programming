# C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings

Welcome to my C project directory for tasks on pointers, arrays and strings. This project directory contains a series of tasks that are designed to cover the following C concepts - pointers, arrays and strings. I am doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).
