# C - Hello, World Project

Welcome to my first C project. This project directory contains a series of tasks that are designed to help me understand and practice C. I am doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).

## Tasks

- 2. Assembler

- 4. Hello, puts
- 5. Hello, printf
