# C - Malloc, Free

Welcome to my C project directory for malloc and free. This project directory contains tasks on this concept in C. I am doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).

## Tasks

- 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
- 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings
- 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
- 3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
- 4. It's not bragging if you can back it up
